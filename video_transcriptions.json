    "-HAFFvsDCr4": " This is an artwork from South Korea called the Round Table. It consists of 18 headless mechanical figures made of straw, each trying to claim a single head rolling on top, while balancing a table on their backs. Whenever one of the figures lifts itself up to try to claim the head, the table tilts, causing the head to roll further away, ensuring the struggle continues. While the figures endlessly suffer, three large blackbirds circle above, representing the upper class watching the struggles of the working class below.",

I suppose you could make a cube any old way, but this one behaves a little bizarrely, and that's because it's not a cube at all. This last one tricks your brain into thinking you're seeing a convex 3D item, an object that behaves sort of counterintuitively when you move it, but in reality, it's a concave 3D object, and with the light, your brain tries to figure out a solution for what it's seeing.

And since this angle right here is 90 degrees, that means that if we were to add up all of these inside angles, x plus 2x plus 2x, all of them have to add up to 90 degrees. So let's go ahead and do that down here. So we have an x, we have a 2x, and we have a 2x. And all of these angles added up has to equal 90 degrees. Okay, so now we can just add up like terms, x, 2x, and 2x, that's going to be equal to 5x. And we have an equals 90. And just like that, we don't have to do any more work because our answer is 90.",

    "DtZdE1P45yQ": " Okay, so today I'm going to be doing something that I think is kind of gross. To get started, the first thing that I'll need to do is add some water to a beaker. Now the next thing that I'll need is a super stinky chemical called hexamethylenediamine. I'll add about 4.4 grams of it to the water, and I'll stir it until it all disappears. It's now all gone, and I'll move on to making the other solution that I need. This one's also pretty simple, and the first ingredient is something called cyclohexane. I'll add about 100 mils of it, and then I'll pour in the last ingredient called adipoyl chloride. I'll mix this up a bit, and now I'm ready to do something nasty. To do this, I need to add 10 mils of each solution to a small beaker. I'll start with the stinky water-based one, and then on top of it, I'll carefully pour in the cyclohexane one. These two liquids aren't able to mix, and like water and oil, they stay separated. Now, all I need to do is use some tweezers. I'm able to pull out a gross, slimy string, and if I wrap it on a glass rod, I can keep pulling it out. I really find that this looks pretty nasty, but it's actually just plastic. More specifically, it's nylon, and it's forming between the two liquids. I can keep pulling it until the chemicals run out, and I'm left with something that kind of looks like a cocoon. It's still full of water and cyclohexane though, and it's all soft and squishy. Now, if I try pulling it apart, it's not actually very strong. This is because all the fibers are extremely thin and fragile. If they were a lot thicker though, like they are in clothing or in a fishing line, it would be a lot harder to do this. I'm going to do this.",

Draw a circle with garlic in a pan and your eggs will cook round. Sprinkle salt on a table and you can stand an egg on it. Fold five toothpicks in half, place them together and add water to the center. The toothpicks will form a star due to water tension. Normally you can't poke a straw through a potato, but if you seal the tip with your thumb, you can easily break through the potato with compressed air. Pour Sprite on a wilted rose and it will come back to life. Shake sand in a pie pan and add a small magnetic ball and it will draw patterns on the sand.

So obviously we're going to have to use PEMDAS, which means we're going to have to do parentheses first. So now we have 8 divided by 2 times 2 plus 2, which is 4. So now when you see division and multiplication, remember that they have the same precedence, meaning that if you see them both at the same time, we're going to have to go from left to right. So 8 divided by 2 is 4, and we still have a 4, so 4 times 4 is 16. Now let's see if you can do this one.",
    "Evie7TV-E8s": " Why is it the tightrope walkers are always carrying a long pole? Well, you fall when your center of mass, basically your body's balance point, goes outside the base of support or your feet. At that point, there's nothing to support you against the pole of gravity, and you topple over. But if you add a pole with weights on each end, look what happens. Adding the weights pulls your cumulative center of mass below your support base. So toppling over now requires it to move up. Gravity is now your friend. It constantly pulls the center of mass back down to stabilize things out. It's the same thing with these balancing bird toys. The wings are weighted, so the center of mass is actually below its balancing point at the beak. Although holding the pole low does lower their center of mass, they don't use huge weights, and that's because the biggest benefit of the pole comes from the link. These two rods weigh the same, but when I spin them with the same force, the shorter one rotates way faster than the longer one. That's because the longer one has more rotational inertia, meaning it's harder to rotate. So if you hold a long pull, that actually makes you harder to rotate as well. And you actually know this, which is why when you're trying to balance, you automatically put your arms out. But there's another trick to stay on a tightrope that doesn't require a pull at all. And it's actually one of the really fun Crunch Labs toys that gets delivered right to your porch, where you build it yourself as I teach you all the juicy physics that make them work. For example, the secret to this tightrope walker. So click through to crunchlabs.com for the most fun and brain-growing holiday gift ever.",

So, we're first going to group these first two terms, and then these last two terms. Then, we can factor x squared from the first two terms. And, we'll factor negative 5 from the last two terms. Now, we can see that the factors will be x squared minus 5, and 3x plus 1. We can further factor x squared minus 5 by noticing that it's the difference of squares. So, we'll factor it as x minus the square root of 5 and x plus the square root of 5. Then, we'll just have this other factor of 3x plus 1. Now, we can see that these three factors are the factors of the polynomial.",
